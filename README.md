# 👋 Hey, I’m Farid Zandi

🎮 Game Developer | 🧠 AI Engineer | ☁️ Cloud Enthusiast  
I'm a passionate full-stack engineer who brings **games to life**, teaches machines to see, and scales apps in the cloud.  
I build systems that are **interactive**, **intelligent**, and sometimes just... **chaotic fun**.
